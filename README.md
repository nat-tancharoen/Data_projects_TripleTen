Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Airbnb | This project analyzes New York City Airbnb listings to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and neighborhood popularity. The goal is to help potential investors make data-driven decisions regarding short-term rental performance. |
| 2 | Superstore | This project analyzes Superstore sales and returns data to evaluate product performance across categories, regions, and shipping methods. Using Tableau dashboards, the goal is to identify high-profit products, detect underperforming segments, and uncover opportunities to increase revenue. |
| 3 | Shopify App Success Analysis (Power BI) | This project explores a dataset of Shopify apps to determine what key factors drive app success including ratings, pricing models, categories, review volume, and feature sets. Using Power BI dashboards, the goal is to uncover the patterns behind top-performing apps and generate actionable insights for merchants, developers, and investors in the Shopify ecosystem. |
| 4 | Business Analytics Project | This analysis explores user purchase behavior using event-level data to evaluate conversion rates, retention trends, and cohort performance over time. By integrating purchase history, user activity logs, and first-purchase timestamps, this project identifies how effectively users convert into paying customers and how long they remain active after their initial purchase. |
